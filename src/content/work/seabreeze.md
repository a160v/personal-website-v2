##### Aribnb clone, from wireframing to shipping on Github

This project required a week to design, build and deploy an Airbnb clone with essential booking functionalities.
The main goal wasn't the app itself, but the understanding the process of building an app and working in team.
First we started with high level wireframes the user flow on on Figma. After few iterations, we aligned on the flow and the desired features.
Then we set up Github > Heroku automatic deploy. Finally we discussed back to the wireframes to turn them into designs.
The <a href="https://uikit.lewagon.com/">UI kit from Le Wagon</a> saved us many hours, while showing us how to get started with UI best practices.

##### Seabreeze, from localhost:3000 to the internet

First we delivered the backend of the homepage (<i>index</i>) and boat page (<i>show</i>), after testing.
After merging all branches in the master, we solved all conflicts and deployed on Heroku.
We ran migrations and seed data to test the production environment.
Finally we worked on the other features.
