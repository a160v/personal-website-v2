#### Aribnb clone, from wireframe to shipping on Github

After 6 weeks of intensive bootcamp, our team of four gathered for a week to design, build and deploy an Airbnb clone.
Two components of the team started with a high level wireframe to sketch in our mind and on Figma the user flow.
The other took care of setting up the repo on Github and Heroku, including the automatic deploy from Github master repo.
Then we discussed on the wireframes: perfectionism and newly acquired skills don't make life easy, but we managed to overcome
this challenge and move forward with the design.
The <a href="https://uikit.lewagon.com/">UI kit from Le Wagon</a> saved us many hours, while showing us how to get started with UI best practices.

#### Seabreeze, from localhost:3000 to the internet

Despite a bumpy start and certain code rework, especially on the homepage and boat page, we solved all conflicts on the master branch
and deployed on Heroku. Heroku friendliness and ease of use through CLI saved us a lot of pain that could have been caused by, for example, AWS or GCP.

#### Technology

- Ruby on Rails 7
- Vanilla JS
- Heroku
